## 🌟 Overview
The **Audio Classification for Real-World Sounds** project aims to classify various environmental sounds using **deep learning**.  
The model is trained on the **UrbanSound8K** dataset using **Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs)** as features and a **CNN** for classification.  
A **Flask-based web interface** is provided for real-time audio classification.
